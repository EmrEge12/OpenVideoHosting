# Rules regarding hosting your own Open site.
These are rules all users of Open *must* follow when hosting their own site. Failure to do so would only cause problems towards your site.
## 1. Making the Terms of Service.
### 1.1. Making your own rules.
You are allowed to have your own rules regarding what many people would deem as 'inappropriate content', this includes stuff such as violence, adult humour, sexual content, nudity, profanity, and mature themes.
Depending on what content you want on the site, you can choose how strict you want these rules to be. For sites aimed at a general audience (typically over 13s), you may choose to prevent pornographic content or excessive gore on the site.
### 1.2. Enforcing those rules.
Make sure your site has enough moderators to help enforce those rules chosen by you. Try to make sure any moderator(s) doesn't abuse the moderator role given by you, if they do, revoke the offender role. 
You must also choose appropriate punishments for the users if they are caught breaking your rules. First-time offenders should only be given minimal punishments (unless it is something serious), such as a 1-hour 'timeout'.
## 2. Open's own rules.
### 2.1. Bot Accounts.
Try to prevent as many bot accounts as possible from your site, such as making/installing anti-bot plugins, enforcing stricter Captchas, etc. Failing to do so may result in your site having a 'bot-epidemic' which may cause server issues and loss
of your user base.
### 2.2. Do not allow illegal content!
Hosters should not use Open to allow users to host what is deemed as 'illegal content', this includes, but is not limited to, any form of child pornography (sexualised content involving anyone under 18 regardless of what your local laws say), realistic and/or brutal child abuse,
threats of any form of terrorism (i.e. bomb threats), or anything regarding rape or life-threatening fetish content. If a user posts anything that would be deemed 'illegal content', immediately permaban or IP-ban the offender, 
remove the video from the server's storage, and contact the proper authorities. Sites that fail to follow this rule could potentially have their site seized by federal authorities.
