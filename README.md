## What is Open?
Open, also known as *The Open Video Hosting Project*, is an entirely handwritten website template, designed for those wanting to make their own YouTube alternative or (using API keys) clone. The name Open is sort of a pun on it being open-source. Currently, it is only in *Alpha*, meaning some features aren't complete yet, but you may feel free to contribute to the Open Project if you want to.

## Common Questions
### How do I host my own Open site?
Information on how you can host your own Open is stored in `HOSTING.md`, but to simplify it, all you need is a server computer, a website hosting platform (like Apache2), any SQL Database, and some PHP and SQL knowledge and your set for life with your little Open site.
### Does Open have its own ToS?
Not really, there are some more common rules you and your userbase must follow described in `RULES.md`, but you can pretty much make your own rules regarding mature or adult content in your Open site.
### How can I contribute to Open?
If you know both PHP and SQL, you can help with the project regarding the video player, security support, etc.
### Why does Open look so... old?
The early web-esque look of Open was intentionally done since Open's UI/UX is based/inspired by early YouTube. You can give your fork a more modern feel if you want.
